This directory contains FreeBSD Update build code.

File				Description
----				-----------
scripts/build.subr		The routines which do all the work.

scripts/build.conf		Configuration settings.

scripts/*.sh			User-accessible scripts.

scripts/X.Y-Z/bar/build.conf	Configuration for FreeBSD/bar X.Y-Z

scripts/X.Y-Z/build.subr and	These files, if present, can override
scripts/X.Y-Z/bar/build.subr	the routines defined in scripts/build.subr
				in order to provide special treatment for
				a particular release or platform.

src/findstamp.c			Utility for comparing two binaries which
				were built from the same source code and
				printing out the locations where they
				differ due to timestamps.

src/unstamp.c			Utility for erasing timestamps found by
				findstamp.c.

patches/X.Y-Z/0-*		Patches to FreeBSD X.Y-Z which we pretend
				were part of the release.  In FreeBSD 5.5
				and FreeBSD 6.0 some of these are necessary
				in order to get rid of some problematic
				timestamps.

patches/X.Y-Z/W-*		Patches to FreeBSD X.Y-Z.  These are applied
				in order of increasing W (assuming it is an
				integer), so a naming convention of setting
				W equal to the FreeBSD patch level (e.g., 9
				for FreeBSD 6.0-RELEASE-p9) is strongly
				recommended.

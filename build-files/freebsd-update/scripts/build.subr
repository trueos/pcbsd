# FreeBSD Update build subroutines.
#
# All the actual work gets done by functions defined here
# and optionally overridden by release-specific and/or
# release-and-platform-specific functions.
#
# Sourcing this is the first thing which scripts do.

### Initialization

# Read global configuration and set global variables.  Run from
# readconfig(), so most scripts don't need to call this directly.
readglobalconfig () {
	# Set paths
	export SCRIPTDIR="`dirname $0`"
	export BASEDIR="`realpath ${SCRIPTDIR}/..`"

		echo "Target platform must be set"
		exit 1
	fi

	# Make sure we have a release specified
	export REL=$2
	if [ -z "${REL}" ]; then
		echo "Release name must be set"
		exit 1
	fi

	# Get global configuration and variables.

	export PUBDIR=${BASEDIR}/pub/${REL}/${TARGET}

	export TMPDIR=${WORKDIR}/tmp

	# Default TARGET_ARCH is TARGET.  On pc98, this needs to be
	# overridden in the platform-specific configuration.
	export TARGET_ARCH=${TARGET}

	# RELP is REL, unless it is changed to be REL-pX instead.
	export RELP=${REL}

	# Make sure the target/release pair make sense.

### Utility subroutines
